🔭 PostWins

PostWins is a governed execution platform for managing cases, grants, and field operations where both speed and provability matter.

It ensures that:

• Every case moves through a controlled, traceable lifecycle — no hidden transitions
• Operational work is structured into defined milestones with measurable progress
• Execution cannot be marked complete without verified evidence
• Funding decisions are tied to validated outcomes — not informal approvals
• All critical actions are permanently recorded, creating a defensible audit trail
• Oversight is distributed across roles, preventing single-point decision risk
• Decisions can be revised transparently — but never erased

PostWins answers the questions stakeholders actually care about:

• What happened?
• Why did it happen?
• Who authorized it?
• What evidence existed at the time?
• What didn’t happen — and why?

It transforms grant and case management into a governed execution environment where accountability is enforced by system design — not policy documents alone.

👥 Who PostWins Is Built For

PostWins is designed for organizations that require operational transparency and financial accountability:

• Nonprofits managing community programs
• Foundations distributing grants
• NGOs coordinating field operations
• Government agencies overseeing public funding
• Development partners funding impact-based initiatives
• Multi-organization programs requiring cross-role governance
• Institutions needing audit-ready operational records

If outcomes must be provable and funding must be defensible, PostWins fits.
