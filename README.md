Why this version is better

It now says:

“I build workflow dashboards and real systems.”

Instead of:

“Here are all the tools I’ve ever touched.”

It matches:
✔ your frontend-focused positioning
✔ your PostWins story
✔ your LinkedIn headline
✔ recruiter expectations

If you want, I can also generate:
• a shorter minimalist version
• a more backend-focused version
• or a portfolio-style version

Just say which.
